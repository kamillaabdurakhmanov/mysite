My research interests include infectious disease epidemiology, public health intervention programs, and clinical trial design. I currently work for the Health Resources and Services Administration as an analyst on their workforce demographic data while I am learning data science in my program right alongside my work. I created this website to provide a a method for others to get a glimpse into my interests and to get to know more about me. On this website you can find methods of contacting me, my CV, more details into my experience, as well as my blog.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "I began as a student intern with HRSA’s Office of Civil Rights, Diversity, and Inclusion in 2023. As an intern, my responsibilities included the analysis of employee demographic data within all of HRSA and within each bureau as requested. I ensured the data was accurate and the analysis was thorough on the basis of race, sex, disability status, etc. These analyses were presented to the office and the bureaus that requested a look at their data in aggregate as contributions to HRSA’s mission to uphold principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\nIn September of 2023, I was proud to have taken the role as a data analyst within the office while I complete my Master’s in Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve University. I use SAS and Excel to analyze demographic and complaint data. I also lead a team of 6-8 employees in taking actionable steps towards making HRSA a model EEO program. One of my team’s most recent projects included the development of an internal policy review guide."

This study was a quasi-experimental study that tests if educating older adults on the DASH-Plus diet program could aid in managing their hypertension. My role in the project included administering the surveys, while assisting and supporting participants in answering questions to ensure the accurate collection of data."

    "text": "Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorder Hack-a-thon Challenge\nTowards the end of 2020, I joined a competition sponsored by the American Society of Echocardiography intended to develop interventions for musculoskeletal disorder among practicing sonographers. Musculoskeletal disorder is highly prevalent in this occupation due to the stress on the back, arms, and wrists when a sonographer is scanning patients. This project was personally close to me as my mother is a sonographer, so I jumped at the chance to contribute. During the competition, my responsibilities included the planning and implementation of a design intended to prevent muscle pain and joint pressure. I worked closely with other students who specialized in engineering and sonography to develop the design, while researching musculoskeletal disorder to develop a full intervention plan."

    "text": "As a student who is just starting off her career in biostatistics, Leek’s opinions on how to build a name for yourself in the modern-day scientific world have greatly contributed to my understanding of the resources available that would expedite the process in finding success. In this blog, I would like to review and insert my own opinion into the most important methods Leek breaks down for developing one’s career in science.\n\n\n\nThe first time I read through “How to be a Modern Scientist” and saw an entire section recommending scientific blogs as a tool to raise your profile, I thought that I could never do it, but here I am. Part of the reason I had this first thought is that I was never one to share my opinions online in the past, especially because I know the “internet loves a fight,” as Leek puts it. However after some consideration in the benefits of being able to share my opinions with the scientific community, here I am convinced. Leek makes several mentions in his book that no matter what is being said online, someone will have something negative to say, and that is just fine because the benefits of a blog outweigh the consequences, especially if you know how to handle “internet scientists”. A blog can be anything you want, from sharing your current projects, to responding to the work of others. It’s a great way to show yourself off through your work, or to discuss a relevant issue in the scientific community.\n\n\n\n\nIn relation to blogging, Leek highlights the importance in the use of social media for a career in science in the modern world. I found this section to be especially helpful for many in my generation who are building their careers alongside the massive boom in the age of social media. I believe the issue is that many people would not know where to start when using social media to highlight their careers. Leek provides a simple break down on the best ways to begin. Creating an account, identifying relevant communities, and developing a network on social media that can help share your ideas and work is what Leek recommends. This may sound like a daunting task for some people, but Leek discusses how there is no need to develop and post original content, it can be as simple as posting your opinions on the work of others or messaging someone in the community whose work you find interesting!\n\n\n\n\nThe final most important piece to Leek’s book is his section on publishing. In today’s world, it seems as if the best way to make yourself known in the scientific community is to have published papers with your name attached to them. Leek breaks down the publishing process from writing the paper, to having it published in the journal, including the details around having the paper be closed or open access and how to respond to criticism. I would recommend this section to anyone who has not yet published a paper and would like to learn more about the process.\n\n\n\nLeek, J. T. (2016). How to be a modern scientist.
